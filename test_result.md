# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

All CRUD operations successful, proper error handling (404 for invalid IDs/routes, 500 for invalid JSON), CORS headers correctly set, data persistence verified in MongoDB. Fixed minor frontend compilation issue (Engine icon import) to enable testing. API handles all required car state fields: engineRunning, currentGear (P/R/N/D/1-5), speed (0-120), rpm (800-6000), carColor (hex), sessionId, timestamp."

Lighting system working with ambient, point, and directional lights. Camera controls (OrbitControls) allow smooth orbit, zoom, and pan. Fixed font rendering issue that was preventing 3D text display.

Smooth 60fps animations with proper timing and realistic effects."

          comment: "✅ STATE MANAGEMENT & SYNCHRONIZATION PERFECT: React state (engineRunning, currentGear, speed, rpm, carColor) perfectly synchronized between UI controls and 3D scene. Validation rules enforced - engine must be running for gear changes (non-P gears disabled when engine off), speed control disabled in P/N gears, proper RPM calculations. Real-time updates: color changes instantly update 3D model, gear changes trigger animations, speed affects wheel rotation. All state transitions smooth and validated."
